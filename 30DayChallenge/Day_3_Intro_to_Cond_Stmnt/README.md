|File Name|changes?|What I learned|Additional Notes|
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
|Intro to Conditional Statement|First submission|Order of if else statment matters|code can be enhanced or written in a different style|
|Intro_to_Cond_Stmnt_V2|Second submission; grouped conditionals|Grouping simplifies the code| can also be enhaced|
|Intro_to_Cond_Stmnt_V3|Third submission; made else if into an else and removing the condition| the last else if statment was unnecessary. It could have been written with just an else since the other satisfied cases were covered and everything else would be the second case| can also be enhaced to have the code written in fewer line codes|
